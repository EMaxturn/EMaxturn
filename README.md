- 👋 Hi, I’m @EMaxturn
- 👀 I’m interested in natural language processing, machine learning, and computational linguistics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python in order to gain skills in machine learning and natrual language processing.
- I plan to leverage my skills in Python in order to learn other relevant languages such as Java, C++, CSS, and HTML.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects in NLP and ML, especially with others who are beginners eager to learn.
